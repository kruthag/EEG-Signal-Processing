# EEG Cognitive State Classification

## Project Description
This project aims to classify different cognitive states using EEG data from the Mental Arithmetic Tasks Dataset available on PhysioNet. The dataset has been pre-cleaned and is ready for use. The primary objective is to implement and evaluate multiple deep learning models to achieve this classification.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the [Mental Arithmetic Tasks Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/eegmat/1.0.0/). For detailed information about the dataset, refer to the accompanying [research paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/4/1/14).

## Objectives
1. Calucate the PSD of the given dataset
2. Implement and evaluate at least two deep learning models using the MNE library.
3. Document the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook.
4. Ensure reproducibility and clarity of the results.

## Models Implemented
1.EEGNet model
2.TSception model

## Outcomes
1.The Power Spectral Density of the dataset is calculated and visualized, providing a better understanding of the data.
2.The TSception model is implemented and trained, achieving the best accuracy.
3.The EEGNet model is also implemented. While my initial attempt did not produce the desired outcome due to experimental changes, I have included a version of the file that is expected to yield the desired results, although it has not been tested as it is not my original work.
